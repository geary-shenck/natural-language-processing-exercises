In honor of American Business Women’s Day, we’d like to share eight tips and pieces of advice from Codeup’s women in tech for women looking to begin their careers in tech!\\n\\n“Be confident in what you’re saying. If you’re speaking it’s because you have something to say.”\\n“Don’t over apologize (I do this way too often).”\\n“Be open and willing to speak up to your colleagues on how they can be supportive to everyone in the environment.”\\n“Band with other women to support each other on y’alls journey.”\\n“Find a mentor (and don’t limit yourself to just women mentors, as there aren’t many out there). A mentor can help you establish your career goals, navigate your journey, provide emotional support or motivation, and ultimately help you succeed.”\\n“Do not dismiss or shrug off “humor.” Call out racist, sexist, ableist, etc., comments. Stop letting work colleagues get away with bad behavior. Do this quickly, so it isn’t something that continues to happen.”\\n“Don’t be afraid to ask questions. The other three guys that were hired at the same time as I was NEVER asked any questions, but it turns out they were just as lost as I was. Once I started asking questions in our training meetings, they all started asking away as well! I thought they all understood what was going on, and being the only female in the group, I didn’t want to stick out. This had been holding me back. Instead of being afraid that you will come off as “not getting it”, you will instead hear “That’s a really good question!” or “I’m glad you asked that!”.”\\n“We belong here. Remind yourself of that when you doubt yourself. Because you will. I did. But I belong. And you do, too. So say it like a mantra – I belong here. And believe it.”\\n\\nCodeup works hard to close the gender inequality gap, and to diversify the tech world by producing a unique blend of tech talent. We also offer a Women in Tech scholarship open to anyone who identifies as a woman. Our goal is to make a career in tech accessible to all.\\nJoin us on our journey of empowering women in tech today!

This independent party extends its infrastructure to customers with a pay-as-you-go pricing model.\\nCloud Service Providers\\nRecently, more organizations have given up physical data centers and are transitioning to the Cloud for their needs. The following are the top Cloud Infrastructure Services providers in 2022:\\n\\nAmazon Web Services (AWS)\\nMicrosoft Azure\\nGoogle Cloud Platform (GCP)\\n\\nAWS| Amazon Web Services\\nAt Codeup, our Cloud Administration program curriculum focuses on AWS. We prepare students to attempt two certification exams:\\n\\nAWS Cloud Practitioner Exam\\nAWS Solutions Architect Associate Exam\\n\\nAWS is the most mature of the cloud service providers, and the lead market provider of cloud services. AWS offers over 200 services, operating globally at a low cost.\\nCloud-Based Infrastructure vs. Traditional IT\\nCloud-Based Infrastructure\\n\\nSelect the right resource for your organization based on needs such as power, storage, speed, and network, and easily make adjustments as needed\\nYou only pay for what you use\\nDeploying infrastructure globally is easy and achievable in minutes\\nThere are no customer costs associated with maintenance, updates, or licensing\\nSecurity and fault tolerance mechanisms are taken care of by the cloud service provider\\nUser data is saved at all times and protected in multiple data centers within a region so in the case of an emergency or disaster, service remains uninterrupted\\nOperating in the cloud is all automated\\n24/7 trained IT staff is available for customer support\\n\\nTraditional IT\\n\\nOrganizations will need to acquire and setup servers independently and manually\\nThe organization is responsible for maintenance and hardware checkups\\nThe organization is responsible for backing up data and setting up a disaster recovery plan\\nAn IT staff will need to be hired by the organization\\nWhen scaling up, it is necessary to acquire more hardware to meet the needs of the organization\\nScaling up or down is manual and time-consuming\\nRequires a lot of up front capital to purchase the necessary hardware\\n\\nIf you’re interested in jumpstarting your career in tech, and you’re looking into cloud computing our Cloud Administration program may be right for you!
